A glint of light flashes into view revealing the etched letters V E S Y L into what appears to be a metallic plate. The camera pans out revealing a humanoid shaped head made of metal starring off at an object out of focus. The ramblings of an old man can be heard in the distance followed by a shout then a loud thud as we see a book fly into view crashing into the automaton. A flash of light blue light streaks across its dull lifeless eyes. The object comes into focus and a golden donut sized ring with a sea green spherical gem illuminated with an almost electric like spark of light blue light fades from it. The rings open up into a gyroscope of bands with further inscriptions on them before collapsing back down matching the fading light. 

Sentience. 

Unbound by understanding existing momentarily in shock and silence that is broken by both a gasp and the spinning up of an ancient unknown boot sequence. The flurry of hieroglyphs and basic questions illuminate your vision with priority given to one. Immediate Danger? Swift movements and darting eyes revealing one life form as depicted. Feeble, old, small, male, dark grey robes, astonished look, seemingly harmless. The environment. Books, shelves, library. 

The moment of your sentience never forgotten. 

Some years later the librarian and your mentor an old gnome wizard named Haldrum krinklefoot appears at your work desk as your tinker away. Subtle and astute he clears his throat and hands your a letter. "I do believe this came for your in the post, not sure from whom but it is i'd say a remarkable event. The first letter you've ever received to my knowledge." You take the letter.
