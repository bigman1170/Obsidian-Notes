**Staff of Swarming Insects  

This staff has 10 [charges](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Magic%20Items?expansion=0#h-Charges) and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.  
  
**_Spells._** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [_giant insect_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:giant%20insect?expansion=0#content) (4 charges) or [_insect plague_](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:insect%20plague?expansion=0#content) (5 charges).  
  
_**Insect Cloud.**_ While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area [heavily obscured](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:The%20Environment?expansion=0#toc_3) for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.

_**Versatile**._ This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Damage:** 1d6 (1d8)  
**Damage Type:** Bludgeoning  
**Properties:** Versatile
