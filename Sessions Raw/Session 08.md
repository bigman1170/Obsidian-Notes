The bandit we tied up, woke up slip out and was instantly killed by [[Jackson]]

We went back to sleep and [[Michael]] was unable to speak after waking.
Brian Cures this curse. And eases his mind.

The old man ha all his old notes and that tells about some chambers that were made, he has had mind alternating spells. He kept all his notes in his field office, which is protected with an arcane lock and hidden behind some illusion spells. He starts digging through the private library and finds some old maps that will help us find the location of the field office. Deep under Zesbul way under the slums. The last three levels here is where the vault might be. The little rat starts casting spells under his breath and appears to get a message. He gave us all his maps for the journey.

[[Jackson]] leads the way. Going the fast way, we see the damage done by the riots. As [[Jackson]] goes outside, he sees a small child take off around a corner, and we start chasing him. Joe [[Dimension Door]]ed to The kid. Then the kid tries to run into a crowd of people fighting and gets knocked out. [[Joe]] saved the child from the crowd, [[Vesyl]] stabilized the child. Brian starts pushing his way to the front of the crowd and found they were fighting over food, [[Brian]] then proceeds to attack anyone trying to take food and wants them to form a single file line in order to get the food. [[Michael]] Starts seeing a person watching us and then teleports up to him on the roof. [[Michael]] hits the man and breaks his ribs, He is the investigator from [[Session 01]]. The child points out that the outpost for the [[Aleaqrab]] is in one of the old lift substations. [[Jackson]] leads the way to the outpost, passing one of the back alleys, we see that there are people watching the elevator. Some of them look like children. The child we had tried to escape and was knocked out by [[Joe]]. The people outside noticed the sound of the bottle hitting the ground. As we went to move [[Vesyl]] and [[Brian]] kicked the bottle and drew more attention to us in the building. We hear noise from upstairs and people coming down.
