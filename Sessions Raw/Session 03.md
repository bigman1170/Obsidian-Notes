	2/16/24 Session 03

We took a long rest and while we were asleep he was trying to break free, We tried to leave this plane again he has a piece that should let us teleport closer to the location

The father goes by shockshier and is the ruler of [[Acidfall Mustaha]] - he does not know if his father had tries to release him before

[[Magister]] believes that he was placed under a sequester spell while in the opal palace before the war

[[Magister]] is a half-breed of (F) celestial and (M) djin - his father is a higher form of an angel wing snake - against the rules of the celestials his father married his mother

The gods and elementals fought each other during the war and that for the opposing sides to marry was extremely uncommon, and it was no shock that his father was kicked out of the realm

His father might still be alive today so long as he has not been killed, as he should have a near infinite lifespan

We started to teleport and ended up in a cave with sounds of flowing water and wind and ponds of water with low green lights coming out of them

We hear gnashing and noises in the distance, it smells horrible in this location as if a body was decaying - What appear to be zombies that are scantily clad in armor

Combat ended

Picked up my crossbow and bolt

Marble man: Lavren

A guy lifted out of the ground, and he appears to be made of marble and has regal clothes on and has a vest on

He looks and just stares out until he snaps looking in our direction and says the young master has returned

Zombie had an emblem with a scepter through the skull on it - There is an under-dark under this and there is a ghoul empire under it and this is there emblem

[[Magister]]s dad was killed by ghouls, [[Magister]] asks if any of the other servers were left and was informed that some survived after they defended the base

The soul of the dad was destroyed and would need a wish to bring him back

[[Travis]] starts harvesting ghoul parts

The servants have been wondering about the [[Magister]]s disappearance, and they catch him up on the locked up

The servant turns and moves his arms and opens a hallway to move us into the base

We are moved into a cavern where there is a locked door that the servants can not get into and the think the now master of the family can open In the cavern there is a broken gate and 2 pools of constantly moving water as well as a sword in a stone with a nameplate on it

The water is tingling our feet and appears to be holy water

The nameplate on the sword reads Marca

The servant leads the [[Magister]] to the locked door , and we are left with a water genasi to guide us while the [[Magister]] goes to the Vault?  

We long rest and after that the [[Magister]] comes back with a floating sword behind him with 2 snakes' holding a gem in their mouth as the hilt and magic letters that change almost every time we look at it, it is unintelligible except what appears to be the spell for feather fall

We follow him out to a room with a giant throne that is just a pedestal with a stand next to it with a circular object with wings and chains on it. there are steps with water flowing into it and treasure on either side of it 

He is giving us the floating [amulet](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4778-talisman-of-pure-good) with rings and chains on it, [[Travis]] goes to pick it up and grabs it and the wings unfold like seraphim wings and has a huge ruby in the center, As [[Travis]] touched it he took a bunch of damage and was knocked out, [[Vesyl]]  healed him for 6 as [[Magister]] said he was not worth to touch the object, [[Travis]] drops the item back on the pedestal. [[Vesyl]]  touched the Talisman and was knocked unconscious and was brought back by [[Travis]] for 4 life. [[Joe]] grabs it and does not take any damage.
