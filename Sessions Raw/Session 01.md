Library in grand brazzar

[[Nzhet'tia]] -Earth Genesi- Libraian said this is Effreet high class family

Nice sandstone house with exotic plants outside - in the garden there is already a party going on
We arrived separately and we were announced to the party
We are lead by the 9ft tall guard to the lady of the house
We were asked to enjoy the part and be there for the after party - when the trumpets go off
We make merry until the party slows down and the trumpets are called
She Gives a speech about how she brought everyone in the after party for our certain roil and how she wants to bring this group together
She had here casters ward off the room we were in before we talk more - did not roll high enough to verify - 
She started talking about slavery and how she and this group do not like and are against
monocle man called out the lady of the house as not Nzhet'tia and then she reveals' herself to be an olive scaled lady with scales and has serpent like eyes and boney cheeks, She is frail and lanky

-[[Malic]]- is her name, she wants to change how this system is run and fix it - Ties to the alcharo

The slums are run down not in the terms of food and water but in the buildings and structures

The nobility has turned a blind eye since the twin princes have taken reign - even out in the nomadic villas there is worm attacks that go unhanded

monocle man asks again about who [[Malic]] replaced and where the family is, she goes on to say that she would show us them as there is more we should know
The guards are 2 Giant snake men that are wide boys, Most of the servants are more snake people with some drow mixed into them with trinkets around there neck torix scorpion
There is also humans and halflings with a curved blade with bat wings on the guard - Some demon lord blade thing

Jester has Pincer as one arm

Malic goes on to say they are alive and will show us them and why she chose them, Leads us down to the cellar, there is a hidden vault door after touching a series of bricks
There is a labyrinth of tunnels as we follow along until it opens up into a well illuminated arena, We are lead to a side booth and are sat with the monocled man
a Disfigured drow seats us and has a jester thing seating us and telling us to get ready for the show
monocled man is not down the the sickness and pulls some wands to sit on his lap while we wait to be shown what is happening
There is a brazier in the center burning some incense burning
The jester askes to take the show from malic
This pit here was found by a scout of malic which is why they choose to toke over this family, it was used as a ring for slaves to fight monsters for there amusement
They will be judged today and forced to fight each other 
The jester had the doors open and a 10 year old child is pushed through the door, followed by her mother for the first fight. -Fire Genesi-
The jester starts the fight, and we can do nothing, the family start to cry together.
monocle man says we should do nothing right now as we will not be able to fight Malic
The girl and her mother get destroyed by a fire elemental
The jester and some people seam really happy, Jester inhaled there smoke
The monocle man says they want something from 2 of us which is why we were invited
One lady tried to run away and they cut her in half
Next to fight are an old man and a teen boy , after our jarring
The boy tries to attach the jest, the jester stops the attack with his claw
The jester said had he tried again he would make it easy on the old man
the old man came to the boy with a sword and kneeled down to be striked down - Boy killed him
The fight goes on and some people do fight back

They finally comes when Malic gets tired, They bring in the head of the family and in doing so the temp goes up a bit

The jester kicks her over and drags her to the center, they bring out the remaining family that won the fights.

They force the family to kill the head in order to live but only the last one that stabs her gets to live. - The young kid was the winner, The joker then decapitates him with the claw

They pointed us out and explained that they wanted Vesyl for his connection to his mentor and the frog man for his ability to clean the water, They knew the inspector was there and threatened his family
We take some bottles of wine from the table on our way out
 We proceed to a police station to talk in a sealed room
 He had been following them for a while after the bombing of other stations
 We know they are a major criminal network
 we think it has to do with the waterways and something down below
 We are gifted a sending stone for each of us to reach him
