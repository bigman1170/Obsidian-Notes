Picking up in front of the palace gate over the dead prince's body. Right after combat.
[[Magister]] comes down and said he was going to investigate the princes rooms, and that if we have something else to do we might want to get going to do that.
[[Magister]] told us how to get down to the lower floors of the city with [[Gate]], before we leave he gave us a note with a phrase on it and that we should give it to the royal guards to signify that we are coming back and that the gates will not work without the signets. 
[[Joe]] walked to the edge trying to get down the swift drop off the palace ground
We went to the closest [[Gate]] that would lead us in the direction of [[Joe]]'s family
as we were going to the closest [[Gate]] there was a sky ship that had been shot down and was heading to the [[Gate]]. As we o through the [[Gate]] we are interrupted by a mob of people, there is a large amount of noise coming from the surroundings, The Flame Guard is protecting the [[Gate]] houses and people jumping over the wall. We are stopped and question by the leader of the Flame Guard, and he wants to know if we are the Reinforcements sent by the nobles. [[Joe]] proclaimed that the Princes are Dead. One of the onlookers who is a dwarvish man and his guards of earth Genasi, He yelled that they handled all the business and then yelled to attack them.
