Picking up in front of the palace gate over the dead prince's body. Right after combat.
[[Magister]] comes down and said he was going to investigate the princes rooms, and that if we have something else to do we might want to get going to do that.
[[Magister]] told us how to get down to the lower floors of the city with [[Gate]], before we leave he gave us a note with a phrase on it and that we should give it to the royal guards to signify that we are coming back and that the gates will not work without the signets.
