Someone cut open the bag of loot from the party, [[Vesyl]]  had the alcohol on me but Flipflop's items all fell on the ground (Character was not here), He grappled the guy who cut open the bag when he was trying to steal all of his stuff.

The frog grappled the guy after he filled his bag with some stuff

[[Vesyl]]  took the small silver skull, the size of a coin

[[Joe]] tried to grapple the frog but failed

[[Vesyl]]  grabbed the bag off of the assailant

The assailant stabbed the frog 

[[Joe]] hits the Assailant and knocks him out

When [[Vesyl]]  went to pick up the candle it blinded everyone around - A bunch of people ran away

[[Vesyl]]  picked up the Assailant and brought him to the guard station

The candle has a symbol on the bottom with raid flames with lines

[[Vesyl]]  hear a voice in my head, and it asks questions about the Candle and where we got it, It froze me in place, but [[Vesyl]]  can still talk.

The rat starts crawling up my body, Brian tries to knock it off my body

The rat climbs up and tries to jump onto the candle, [[Vesyl]]  moved it out of the way, It climbs up my shoulder, and it whispers in my ear and says that [[Vesyl]]  will calmly carry this to a more disclosed location,
[[Joe]] tried to stop me but [[Vesyl]]  slipped through and proceeded to calmly walk to a discreet location

[[Vesyl]]  get to the location and the rat goes through the bag and finds a cracked lantern in the bag

[[Vesyl]]  was compelled to light the candle

It took forever but the answer was water

we got sucked into a cracked lantern 

There we fined a dripped up celestial that has crystal growing off his body that are in different shapes and colors - rat calls him [[Magister]]

The astral sea is in turmoil and all the lands are recovering but still damaged 

The [[Magister]] might be stuck in this pocket dimension and has been stuck here for 400+ years

We failed to get back after being teleported by [[Magister]]
