These items are from [[Magister]]'s dad's hoard

The reason he does not say his name is that if he gives it to us, the gods can pull him to them with the spell [[Gate]]

[[Magister]] has a Decree to rule over opal, and he wants us to go to the palace to announce it.
He wants us to be his hype men, [[Joe]] wanted to speak privately, [[Magister]] set out a feast with the help of [[Lavren]] then left. [[Joe]] brought up the fact that this might not be the best idea, since he is a blasphemous existence. We discussed this, and we came to the conclusion that we should go with him but expect that when a ware breaks out we will be on his side. [[Magister]] appreciated that we choose to follow him, and gave us his run-down and showed us an iron flash with a cork top. [[Magister]] said he wanted to release it on the city as it will help him in his decree as a ruler over the city. The flask holds someone inside of it and know that knows him, he will not try to kill him. [[Magister]] is against slavery, we agree to his plan. The next day we head over to the palace by why of teleportation circle, we show up in the castle in front of guards and they seem surprised. A guard steps to us, and we push him to get the prince for a royal decree to be announced. Eventually the Princes come out to meet us with performers in tow as well as food. The princes are floating behind the performers, and are announced by one of the butler looking dudes. The tension in the air is broken by one of the princes whispering in the ear of the other one's ear, When they do turn back all the people turn and look back in sync. They question us and how we got here and if they know about the murder of the [[Nzhet'tia]] and they want to know why we're here. [[Magister]] says that his ancestor were the Wind Dune of Aaqa, The princes say it's not possible as they died 400 years ago. [[Magister]] pulled the flask out and rips the cork out and dark air erupts from the flash and a being fly out of the smoke. We hear whisper, and it turns it head looking down at [[Magister]] and says I'm impressed, everything has changed and that he feels it the times of troubles far away there is a land a seer speaks to me AO lost his power for a moment in time, and it sent a ripple back in time, devils have twisted the way of law here, an old gold sleeps here, the key to your vault is missing, this brings doom to you, in the east a country sufferings to the release of the far realms, north-east Orcus marches an army of the dead across the sea to destroy the elves, in that land of elves that seer speaks to me. He is heralded to fight a war. There was an illusion cast over the entire city. There are eyes in the illusion, and it forms into a face, it says it's the seer, the times of troubles that he speaks of and AO removal of power means that the gods can die, Riots start in the streets. [[Magister]] looks like he already knew this was going to happen and that he knew this info before. [[Magister]] pulled out the royal Decree showing that he would be the new ruler of this city, and asked if they believed him now. More people start to show up in the courtyard, [[Jackson]] comes out with his boss which is a aged elf and a Djin who is an inspector. The Efreeti prince is furious of what has just transpired, The blue prince is in shock as the performers start to leave. The fey wilds have separated from us completely and is currently recovering from an attack of the 8th level of hell. The Winter queen was killed next to this [[Talisman of Pure Good]] and the shadow fell is full of demons and the raven queen is dead, [[PCS/Jackson|Jackson]] almost died of heart attack. The blue prince transforms into a Rakshasa.  The Rakshasa is thrown to another dimension from the [[Talisman of Pure Good]] as combat starts
