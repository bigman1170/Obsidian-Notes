**Shifting Dunes of Alwan Mutaeadida**, or Dunes of Many Colors. It's a marvel to see. Certainly an aftermath of the explosion it harbors a color for each dune that shift and move about restlessly. A slow shifting of the hilly sands, coupled with theÂ  bright illumination the sands give off at night that blocks the stars from view, makes it near impossible to navigate at any time.
