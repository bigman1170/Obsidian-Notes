The Zeymun Empire is a desert bordering the sea on one side and a spine of earth on the other. It is known as harsh, environmentally and socially.

  

Environmentally; dust storms, unbearable heat, Lack of water, and dangerous monsters. It is said that 400 years ago when the gods waged war Zeymun a lush oasis of the world was devastated by the destruction of the war turning the region in a barren desert wasteland.

  

Socially; social standing is that of a strict caste system in the region. Slavery exists heavily as a form of free workforce and entertainment. Many of the lower caste system is lost into the sea of slavery. Nobles are very authoritarian and corrupt with greed. The middle class is the second smallest of the caste and barely scrapes by. In most cases folks who are able, and do not have deep rooted history/cultural ties to Zeymun or dreams of becoming much more than humble folk, tend to leave the region.  

  

Opal and Nethelas work in tandem to each other.  
  
Opal being the capital is a trade hub filled with bustling streets and numerous bazaars in almost every district. Exporting and importing goods through portals, air ships and conventional methods. Opal/Zeymun derives majority of all of its wealth from the mined precious gems and jewels of Nethelas. Drawing all manner of artificers and jewelry crafters. It is also known as a slave trading capital of all of Eythea. Home to brutal gladiatorial arenas and "hunts" killing for sport as well as many other manner of awful and benign indulgences. It is also the most diverse capital in world containing many well guarded portals mainly to the different elemental planes.

  

Nethelas is a Metropolis of slaves and mechanical beings. Under control of a hierarchy of that directly answers to the council of opal. A mining facility on the edge of the Zeymun empire is worked by slave

and machine alike. Most of the humanoid slaves are actually tinkerers and mechanics for the constructs.

  

Zeymun is home to many dangerous and mythical creatures. The strongest have perished or been enslaved and the wealthiest have disappeared. Fiends have been known to spill out into the desert hills met by celestials continuing the conflict of their leaders. Both fought back by the elemental powers the djinn who claim this land.

  

It is known that the southwest region of Zeymun is infested with giant worms.

  

The underdark of Zeymun mainly persists under the desert itself and part of the mountain range near Nethelas. From time to time the sentinels of Nethelas fight off a horde of darakhul ghouls who roam and control the underdark in this area of the world.
