**Zaluj Coast**, or Glass Coast is a coastline that extends for roughly 350 miles. It's sheen and sparkles are blinding and dangerous to travel across. The heat reflected here from the desert sun could cook or melt seemingly anything. Shards of glass wash back and fourth on the boiling shore, footing of hard glass can give way to shard filled vats of melting glass like quicksand. Strange creatures immune to fire have been seen on the edges of this territory in the narrow in between the Glowing Waste and Zaluj Coast.
