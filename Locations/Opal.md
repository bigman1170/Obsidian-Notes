The bustling trade hub that is Opal is only in a very slight amount of unrest of discourse due to the situation in Nethelas. Currently The dual Sultans, a Efreeti and Djinn who have chose to rule combined for a stent of 14 years are leading a prosperous economy and are well received. The profits of said economy worry some as most of it goes to lavish public parties that the sultans throw to appeal further to their people. A wary one would assume something is up as some do, they believe the Sultans hide something and use their loved expenditures to cover up something and keep the public eye distracted. 

There has been a small draft to raise forces and send as aid for Nethelas.


Ruling Houses, The Divine Three

  

"A silver turban gusts in the azure winds of the monsoon"- House of the Djinni

This house consists of the second in command to each legion of the Citadel of Ice and Steel. They answer directly to their respected leaders and The Great Caliph himself who shows high interest and has been seen in Opal from time to time, Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim is his known name (I fucking know right). These members are rotated out every few 7 years allow others to take their place and take turns ruling.

-Teeth of the Wind

-Azure Legion

-Monsoon Legion

-Silver Turban Legion 

  

"Warm waters flow over a iridescent pearl."- House of the Marid

Here are members of marid nobles that number more than the other houses. They all vie for the seat of sultan when it comes around and a cutthroat debate with voting takes place before hand. This padishate answers to The Great Padishate of the Marid, (i shit you not) Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari.

  

"The fire burns all unworthy of it's warmth."- House of the Efreeti

Mainly comprised of The Grand Sultan Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan's family and a few of the The Unquenchable Legion. The house choose it's selected to reign by which fire burns the hottest by having a tournament. The matches are available to watch by most of all the upper class/nobles.
